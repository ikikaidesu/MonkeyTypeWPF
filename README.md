## About

<p>Monkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable <a href="https://www.monkeytype.com">typing test</a>. It features many test modes, an account system to save your typing speed history, and user-configurable features such as themes, sounds, a smooth caret, and more. Monkeytype attempts to emulate a natural typing experience during a typing test by unobtrusively presenting the text prompts and displaying typed characters in place, providing straightforward, real-time feedback on typos, speed, and accuracy.<br><br>
<code>from myself:</code> When creating this project, I studied such a pattern as MVVM for WPF. Studying it was not easy for me due to the fact that there is quite a bit of information on it, which is why I often turned to SO, created crutches, or perhaps (most likely) violated the pattern altogether. While creating the project, I tried something new (which you can notice, because sometimes there are things that I wrote differently).</p>


## Disadvantages
<p>By inaccuracies I mean what I did not do due to certain circumstances, which was not implemented in this project: Player level, player description, advanced viewing of projects, Percentage in the top among users, attendance statistics, scatter plot filters, additional. column graph, viewing all tests (1000), alerts, errors, settings, top users, information, language selection, customizing test parameters, interaction with test results. As you understand, most of this has not been implemented because this is a program, not a website, but something still hasnâ€™t been done due to my laziness.</p>

Most likely I won't work or add to it further, but who knows...
